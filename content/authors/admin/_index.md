Bioinformatician specialising in large-scale transcriptomics analysis (e.g. RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq). Proficient in bash, R, Python and navigating the linux environment.\
\
Currently working in a team comprising bioinformaticians and software engineers to deploy scalable bioinformatics workflows in the cloud that runs on the AWS serverless infrastructure (https://www.gedac.org). Fluent in writing WDL scripts for workflow construction and in containerising applications with Docker.\
\
A developmental biologist by training, I attained my PhD in Genetics at the University of Cambridge where I combined my skills in laboratory work and bioinformatics to investigate cell-fate decision making in the early zebrafish embryo. My biological background allows me to communicate effectively with collaborators and to grasp the biological questions underpinning a diverse range of consultation projects.
